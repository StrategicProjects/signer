Description: This package provides functions to digitally sign PDF documents and verify their signatures. It leverages external tools like `BatchPDFSignPortable.jar` (for signing) and `pdfsig` (for signature verification). The signing function allows adding custom text to the signature, and both signing and verification support localization for English and Portuguese.

Note:
    This package makes use of the BatchPDFSignPortable.jar, a Java-based tool for signing PDF documents. The BatchPDFSignPortable tool was created by Josep Marxuach (https://github.com/jmarxuach/BatchPDFSign). 
    The package also uses the `pdfsig` command-line tool, part of the Poppler library, for verifying PDF signatures. The Poppler project is maintained by the Poppler developers (https://poppler.freedesktop.org/).
